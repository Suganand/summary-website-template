## Overview {#overview}

We aim to build products without barriers for disabled users.

We work towards the [government accessibility requirements](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction#meeting-government-accessibility-requirements):

> - meet level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1)](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wcag) as a minimum
> - work on the most commonly used [assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) - including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools
> - include [disabled people in user research](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/running-research-sessions-with-people-with-disabilities)
> - have an [accessibility statement](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement#decide-if-anything-is-a-disproportionate-burden-to-fix-right-now) that explains how accessible the service is

### Why the Government Accessibility Requirements? {#why-gov-access-requirements}
- a strong standard of accessibility that is applicable for all of our clients, not just Gov/NHS
- all public sector client work needs to meet some minimum legal requirements.
- some public sector projects have [service assessments](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/how-service-assessments-work) including these requirement.

### What are the minimum legal requirements? {#minimum-legal-requirements}

When our advocacy has failed or we have constraints outside our control, we should work to meet our client's legal obligations.

For public sector clients, to meet the Public Sector Accessibility Regulations, you need to:

- meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 (WCAG) to level AA as a minimum 
- have an accessibility statement

Private sector clients who work with public sector bodies often have the same standards.

The Equality Act 2010 means companies must not discriminate against Disabled customers.

Talk to the client to understand their legal obligations.

Try to aim for WCAG 2.1 level AA compliance as a minimum.

## As an engineer or data person, what can I do? {#what-can-i-do}
