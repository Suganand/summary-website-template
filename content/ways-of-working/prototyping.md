# Prototyping

Prototyping helps us explore an idea quickly so that we can test it with end-users or increase our understanding.

Prototypes should not be perfect, focus on speed and learning then archive the prototype code when you're done.

To chat about prototyping, join the [#prototyping slack channel](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/CKE2470L8).

## User facing prototyping

When you want to understand how well a user facing feature is working.

In user research this can be done with a LoFi prototype but often we build something that feels real.


### Using an existing codebase

If you have an existing codebase, consider making a branch and prototyping with that deploying is separately, this work can be removed after.

Do not put your prototype code into production, plan to rebuild it properly once your experiments are concluded.

### GOV.UK & NHS.UK Prototype Kit

The recommended way to prototype GOV.UK, NHS.UK, or form heavy services:

- [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://prototype-kit.service.gov.uk/docs/)
- [NHS.UK Prototype Kit](https://nhsuk-prototype-kit.azurewebsites.net/docs)
- [Unbranded Prototype Kit](https://github.com/hippo-digital/unbranded-prototype-kit)

Prototypes are built with code and is understood by some designers so the wider team can get involved.

## Technical prototyping or 'spikes'
For some technical problems, it is not always clear if it's possible to solve it or if it'd take too long to implement.

- Focus on what is least clear and risky.
- Time box the activity, for example only 1-2 days.
- Document what you learn with any decisions.

If it's not easy to make a decision on your own, present different options with their pros and cons to the team.
