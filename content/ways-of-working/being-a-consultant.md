# Being a consultant

## TL;DR

* An evidence driven delivery is the primary focus. 
* Try a solve the problem first before asking the client, we have lots of expertise in house use it. Get stuck into a problem, be an engineer not a *developer*
* Need to own the epics/tasks/stories you are given, make sure we are doing the best for a client
* Recognise that nobody has a perfect infrastructure/architecture, there will always be problems, run with it but make considered suggestions on how to improve it.
* There is always other work that can be done, while waiting for User Research / Design phase to be completed. Monitoring, Build, Testing etc..

## Introduction 

At hippo we are all consultants, but consultancy is a very broad concept and needs to be defined at a company and a role level. Within Hippo the definition of consultancy is as follows 

> *Consulting at Hippo:*
> 
> The provisioning of informed advice and the application of specialist knowledge and experience to an organisation in support of achieving long-term organisational objectives within their given context and constraints.”
>
> * *60%* of our work is in the application of technical or specialist knowledge and experience in delivering product and service-oriented outcomes aligned to our client's long-term organisational objectives and goals.
>
> * *30%* of our work is overseeing and coordinating our interactions with our clients and potential clients, and taking accountability for these relationships to ensure positive, long-term outcomes for both Hippo and the client.
>
> * *10%* of our work is in providing informed advice to contribute to strategy, structure, management and operation decisions in support of achieving long-term organisational objectives and goals.


## Applying this to Engineering and Data

Unlike Product & Delivery or Design, Engineering and Data is often not as client facing and we don't have the commercial management aspects of roles in Product and Delivery (unless you are in a Management Consultant, Service Delivery Lead or Engagement Lead role). So does this mean that the client management 30% and the strategy side 10% can be ignored and the focus is 100% on technical or specialist knowledge. 

In short the answer is No it can't be ignored. You should always have **all** of these aspects in your mind. While you may not be involved day-to-day in commercial decisions or client management. Engineering and Data roles are often working across a wide range of teams (Security, Architecture, Other product teams, Support Teams and Quality Assurance for example) within a client. This means engineering and data are often prime placed to spot opportunities for expansion. So while not a priority the commercial and strategy work should be in your mind at all times.

The longer answer depends on your role and seniority in a project and is fully defined in the [skills framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1veclKwLUe0GP7nwuDPtq6zEgC6WmkH1nJMTO5JfTECI/edit#gid=1609719988)

However no matter your role to be a great consultant you should: 

### Focus on pragmatism over perfection

While everyone aspires to create a perfect solution solving all of the problems for the user, the reality and complexities of the real-world mean this often isn't possible. So instead work to ensure what the pragmatic solution is, this might mean making compromises in an area to provide more focus on another area. For software engineers this result is often reduced to the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), don't over design or design pre-maturely. A classic example is fully abstracting a database used in your solution. Ask yourself when have you ever swapped out a DB in a production system. 

From the point of view of a project, this can mean a variety of things, but really it is don't sweat the small stuff. If tickets aren't perfect but they are understandable and contain enough information to do your job, just get on with it. Raise it of course, but it should be done at the correct time a retrospective for example.
 
### Don't blindly follow the hype

In Engineering and Data there is alot of hype around technologies and process. Microservices, Agile are two examples that immediately spring to mind, albeit for different reasons. 

Microservices have become a ubiquitous architectural pattern, made famous by Amazon, Netflix etc. However, they come with an extremely large overhead, error handling becomes extremely tricky, visibility and monitoring becomes hard as does reporting. Only in extreme scale (which we do occasional have projects which come in this bracket) is the complexity down payment worth it.

Agile, was treated as a silver bullet when it was first pronounced and Hippo is a predominantly Agile consultancy (it says it on our website). However, we are a consultancy and there are numerous methodologies within Agile, SCRUM, Kanban, XP, SAFE, Flightlevels. That all solve different problems and you should pick the one that most suits your team and ways of working. That being said, Waterfall isn't a dirty word either. In fact for some projects it may be the best methodology to follow; especially if there are regulatory, or a deep stakeholder decision tree entrenched within the client.

### Pick your battles

A large part of being a consultant is challenging people and being a consultant at Hippo openness and honest is also a key part of those. However, there are times to have conversations that challenge people. Even if presented with the best of intentions, challenging someone is likely to evoke an emotional response, which will be compounded even more if that is done in a large meeting or public forum. If there is an issue that is likely to be controversial or evoke an extreme response, it is often better to save those conversations to a less public forum. When stakeholders are involved it is often better to raise it within the project with other Hippo's first. Asking if they noticed anything similar, or ask for a reflective point of view on the situation. 

Taking a break, reflecting and not responding straight away achieves to things: 

1. Removes the emotion out of the situation, allows you to gather the logical argument
2. Gives time for you to gather consensus. 

Although this might seem time-consuming doing this will save you time and make your life alot easier; as you know you are fighting a battle that matters to more than just you.

Conflict will arise on a project at some-point since everyone is passionate and driven to achieve the best possible outcome. But take a pause and think is this the correct time. Especially if there are client stakeholders around.

### If it isn't working FIX IT.

In a similar theme to the previous section *Focus on pragmatism over perfection* we should be willing to make changes, if things aren't working. However, people have a tendency not to change and keep on working in the same way. While this approach is ok and might actually lead to the delivery of an outcome; often you will have expended far more energy than is required to get to the outcome. This leads to a much higher risk of burnout for team members. 

On the flip side of this changing to quickly can destroy team morale and delivery. So there is a balance to be had. We should not be scared to change but we need to make sure we are changing for the correct reason and that we understand that the reason is the root cause and not a symptom. Identifying root causes and applying critical thinking is a key part of being a consultant, practising making the correct change for that correct reason will allow you to become a more effective consultant.

### Remove your ego

We are employed as consultants, this fundamentally means that someone has decided to pay for our services, because we are experts in a particular set of capabilities that they may not have or are growing. This doesn't automatically mean though that we can assume that our opinions are always correct. As consultants we must **listen** to our clients and peers; they will always have more context about internal constraints, or details. Furthermore, all of your peers come from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences, they will see things different to you and while you might not agree make sure you take onboard everything they say as I guarantee you will learn something. This is one of the best things about being part of a consultancy. Along these same lines a consultancy is a big support network, if you aren't sure, do some research to frame the question, but ask questions early, this will save you heaps of time and frustration. If no-one has the answer it is almost certain that someone will want to work with you on discovering the answer to the situation.
