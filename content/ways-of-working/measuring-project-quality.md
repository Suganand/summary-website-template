# Project Quality

Quality is a key driver in us winning more work; we aim to leave clients in a better state, than we arrive with them. While some of the items in the more detailed checklist below may not be possible due to client constraints/environment or other issues and different ways of working, however at a minimum, we should always

## Minimal expectations

It is important that you understand each of the themes in this spreadsheet, at a minimum however we MUST: 

* A documented and followed branching strategy
* A clear automated build process that includes: 
  * Linting and code style checking
  * Automating testing with appropriate coverage percentage (>80%) (Unit and Functional - however security and accessibility tests should also be seriously considered)
  * Automated deployment ideally utilising Terraform, but CloudFormation/ARM are also fine.
* Architecture documentation, aligned with the structure (or similar) presented in the [documentation templates repository](https://github.com/hippo-digital/documentation-templates/tree/main/architecture)


Where we do completely own the direction and outcome we should strive to makes as much of the full technical review "Green" as possible.
