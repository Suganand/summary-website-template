# Hippo Internal Work

Hippo internal work, is the work we do when we are off project (sometimes referred to as the Bench or HIT). When you are about to come off an engagement there are several tasks you can get involved in. The first thing to do is to join the [internal_engineering_work slack channel](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C044ZET6KA5). To avoid the HIT process being a free-for-all and to support the business there is a priority order for this work. If there is no work on a section move down the stack. 

## Priority of work 

### New work
* Support the Bid team
* Support marketing (Blogging, Design in a Day, Conferences)
* Shadowing (where possible on client work to learn about other team ways of working and best practice)

### Recruitment support
* Interviews (pairing / leading) - reach out the [engineering-and-data-interviews slack channel](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C02UMC9RSLA)
* C.V Vetting - reach out to your line manager
    
### Engineering and data community improvement work
* Pick up tasks from the [engineering and data community backlog](https://github.com/orgs/hippo-digital/projects/1). 

### Research & Development
* Identify and Research new technologies that can be used to develop future capabilities

### Personal Development

To make sure your personal development is as focused as possible, please make sure that you have a personal development plan signed off by your line manager. If you don't have one arrange a meeting to create one at the earliest possible moment. Providing structure around learning, helps you but also ensures that we can match you to the roles that most suit your current skillsets and capabilities. See [the learning and development page]() for more information.
