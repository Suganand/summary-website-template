# Interviewing

## Philosophy / Aim

Our aim with interviewing is not to catch people out, but to create a baseline of their knowledge and evaluate whether that baseline meets the criteria for Hippo. With this in mind:

* We aren't trying to trick people by asking abstract questions instead we are trying to see how they think
* We want to test their overall knowledge of technologies, identifying that they have used the technologies listed on their C.V
* We want to ensure that they have the consultant mindset; Can they think critically can they change their approach based on a change in circumstances. 
* We want people who are ambitious and keen, want to work in Hippo and you want to work with them. Remember interviews are a two-way thing. They are interviewing us as much as we are interviewing them. So smile ðŸ™‚

### Evaluating how people think

This is the aim of the technical portion of the interview, we aren't necessarily focused on whether they get the question 100% correct, identifying all the issues. What we are focused on however is what they are focusing on. For example in a code review exercise people who are focusing on whether it will compile or not are sort of missing the point. You often have tooling to assist you with this instead, the candidate should be focused on the logic and construction of the method under review. There is further guidance on this in the interview material linked below.

### Testing knowledge

Ultimately we want to ensure that candidates have actually used the technologies that they are listing on their C.V's. This goes further than just knowing about them. For example, if someone lists a specific AWS service one good probing set of questions is: 

* Would you use it again and why?
* What are the issues with that product / how could it be made better?
* If you suddenly couldn't use that product what product/suite of products could you replace it with? 
* How do you think that product works under the covers?

Again we aren't looking for perfect answers (especially to the last question, because they will probably be wrong), but just that they can evidence that they have actually used that service. I typically repeat this for 2-3 technologies they have listed on their C.V. A final note, if they are struggling to answer the first question you ask, don't persist, drop it and move on. 

### Consultant mindset

In Hippo we aren't just engineers, data analysts, QA's etc... we are consultants. We need to be able to adapt to ever-changing situations in our clients. It is therefore really important to inspect the candidates ability to do this. This is traditional competency based interviewing and there are lots of materials on the web but the essence of the technique is to get the candidate to answer in the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Response) style. This makes it easier to evaluate. There is a selection of questions in the interview pack that encourage this.
