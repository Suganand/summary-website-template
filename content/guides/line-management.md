# Line management

Most of our general guidance around line management can be found on [Hippo's How now #line management channel](https://hippodigital.hownow.app/user_pages/channel_courses?master_tag_id=12457)

There is also a channel [dedicated to lattice](https://hippodigital.hownow.app/user_pages/channel_courses?master_tag_id=16567)

## In Engineering & Data

### Managing learning 

With the choice and breadth of technologies that exist in the world today it can be baffling choice to decide with pathway to go down. Combining this with the variation of technologies and way-of-working presented by our range of clients means that we need to be careful around how we manage learning in the Engineering and Data space. While there is no silver bullet to cut through this complexity, prioritising learning based on the following may help 

1. Current project technology stack
2. Future aligned project technology stack
3. AWS / Azure and other partner certification pathways such as Splunk, Snowflake, Cribl etc.
4. Consultancy skills aligned with the Skills Framework (although this should be a general on-going development)
5. Emerging technologies, for example (relevant at time of writing), Low code / Automation platforms, ML applications in security.

### Supporting development of consultancy skills

In Hippo everyone is a consultant (not the role). However this has quite a broad meaning to help define what consultant means for your reports we have put together a skills framework, this has the each role and the consultancy expectation for each of them. It is important to note that this isn't a tick box exercise, the behaviours in this document need to be **consistently** displayed over a period of time to be considered for promotion.
