# Time sheets

Time sheets are currently managed in our PSA system, which is Kimble. Time sheets are to be filled in as follows: 

1. By close of play Friday, for each working week
2. By the final day of the month. Sometimes this occurs mid-week. 

Reach out to [#support-kimble-operations slack channel](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C030JB59TRV) if you need any help or you need a project / task adding to your timesheet. 

For instructions on how to fill in a timesheet can be found [here](https://hippodigital.hownow.app/user_search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_term=timesheets)

## Why are time sheets important?

Time sheets are a critical process in a consultancy. Why? Because it is the only way we can get paid for the work we have done. If the company gets paid that means our cashflow stays healthy and it means we can pay your salary. Which I think you'll agree is a good thing.
