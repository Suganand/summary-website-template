# Licenses 

If you need licenses you can raise a request in the Halp slack app, and someone will contact you with a license, or some follow up questions.  

While there are many other licenses available, for engineering and data we have

* Pluralsight
* Data Camp
* A cloud guru
* Docker
* BrowserStack
* Azure and Visual studio licenses 
* JetBrains - access to the all product pack, which provides access to all of [JetBrains IDE's](https://www.jetbrains.com/)
