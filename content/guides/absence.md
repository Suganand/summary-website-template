# Absence

## Sickness

Everyone at some-point feels under the weather, Hippos are no different (although we work hard on the welfare of our staff). However, when you are ill there is a process to ensure it can be recorded properly and appropriately managed with our clients.

## Holidays

Everyone needs a break, however we aim to do this with minimal disruption to any team and project you are working in. Broadly the process is: 

### When you are on a project 

* Speak to your SDL / Delivery Manager and ask about your time off. This allows people to plan work / timelines / roadmaps around your absence
* Once confirmed by the SDL confirm the holiday with your line manager
* Request the time off in [bamboo](https://hippodigital.bamboohr.com/)

### When you are on internal work

* If you are aligned with an internal project then speak to the owner of that project.
* Confirm the holiday with your line manager
* Request the time off in [bamboo](https://hippodigital.bamboohr.com/)

## For Line managers

Managing sickness can be challenging for line managers, we also have some [guidance to support line managers as well](https://hippodigital.hownow.app/members/course_play/93466133/lessons/110336)

Any questions about any of the above feel free to send a message to [People ops](mailto:peopleops@hippodigital.co.uk) or speak to your Line Manager / Portfolio Director.
