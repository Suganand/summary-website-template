# Communities in Hippo

There are a wealth of communities through out Hippo and we encourage you to get stuck in to get the best out of your experience at Hippo.

You can browse the various communities at [our community website](https://hippo-digital.github.io/communities/)

As well as the dedicated communities above, we of course have slack channels that act as mini-communities; While there are many new channels created weekly, the ones below are the more persistent channels.

##Â Slack Apps

We have a selection of slack app's available for various integrations that can be installed on demand but the ones you really should have activated are

* Halp - This allows you to raise support, software and technical requests
* Lattice - Allows you to give feedback, manage reports, set agenda items for 1:1's all through slack

It is also worth noting if you are struggling to find channels there is among the maelstrom of channels actually a convention, based on the prefix of the channels

* `#support` - These are typically support channels for example `#support-tech` is a channel for all of your hardware related questions. It can also be used to request hardware upgrades and additional pieces of equipment for offices / home working. 
* `#work` - These are typically active project channels where Hippo's can have a discussion about the project they are on. __Note: this shouldn't be a replacement for discussion in the backlog__
* `#bid` - These are typically channels that revolve around active bids.
