# Welcome

Welcome to hippo digital. Congratulations on your first day. We are very pleased to have to here with us ðŸ˜ƒ

Starting a new company can be an exciting but scary experience, so we have put together this guide to help you along your first weeks within Hippo. 

Over the onboarding period we typically carry out the follow: 

1. Meet various people in the organisation. This can will be a variety of people from Directors, Principals and other members staff. 

2. Meet your [line manager](/guides/line-management.md).

3. Take you through our processes for things that make the company work; [timesheets](/guides/timesheets.md), [holiday requests, sickness](/guides/absence.md) etc. 

These and other tasks should be presented to you via an on-boarding trello board on your introduction to the company by people operations. 

Any questions feel free to reach out directly to your line manager, on the [engineering and data community slack channel](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C01JZP5M0DD), or directly to any of the directors, we will all be more than happy to assist. 

## Whats next?

Depending on the stage you are at in the onboarding process there maybe somethings that you want to do next

1. Read some guidance on [setting up your machine](/onboarding/setting-up-your-machine.md). 

2. Get involved in some [slack channels and communities](/onboarding/slack-and-communities.md)

3. Join the [#internal-engineering-work](https://hippo-digital.slack.com/archives/C044ZET6KA5) slack channel. This is where we manage internal Hippo projects. When you aren't on client work. You can read more about [this process here](/guides/internal-work.md)
