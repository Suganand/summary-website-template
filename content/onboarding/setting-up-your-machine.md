# Setting up your machine

Depending on the role you have been hired in there are several different options for this and of-course the actual machine setup will likely change dependant on the client work you're doing. It is entirely upto you to whether you follow this guidance or not. That being said there are some key pieces of software you should have installed. 

* **[Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/)**
* **HexNode** - This should be installed by default however if it isn't please reach out in the `#support-tech` slack channel 
* **Bitdefender** - This should be installed by default however if it isn't please reach out in the `#support-tech` slack channel (told you slack was a key piece of software ðŸ˜œ)
* **[Access to the Hippo Engineering and Data Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kIKHQ1yPuS5HHvn0pZ2FB8VFgoIlAViU)**

the other software we use in Hippo is very project dependant but a small sample of these are:

* **[Miro](https://www.miro.com/)** - This is used internally within Hippo if you need a license sign-up at the above **with your Hippo Email** and you'll be granted access
* **[Figma](https://www.figma.com)** - Lots of the design community use this to create site/service designs. While there is no company wide license, it is good to be familiar with this tool
* **[Diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/)** - Used for alot of architecture diagrams, by alot of our clients and integrates with 

Given your role there might be some sections that you want to skip to the relevant section, it is also worth noting that preference is everything for productivity for the roles in engineering and data. So treat the following information as more of a guide than a doctrine.

* [I'm a developer (front, back, full-stack)](#developer)
* [I'm a test engineer](#test-engineer)
* [I'm a data engineer](#data-engineer)
* [I'm a data analyst](#data-analyst)
* [I'm a technical/data architect](#datatechnical-architect)

# Developer {#developer}

* **Your favourite IDE** - We have licenses for all JetBrains IDE's and Visual Studio code you can see how to request these [here](../guides/licenses.md). Of course you can always use another IDE like Visual Studio Code, EMACS, VIM if you wish. As I said your choice.
* **Docker** - [Again see](/guides/licenses.md)
* **Source control GUI/Terminal** - GIT is used across all of our clients. To this end you must have a GIT source control tool that you are comfortable using. For more information about GIT see [here](https://git-scm.com/)

* **A diagramming tool / architecture repository** - For diagramming we use a mix of [Diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/), [Miro](https://www.miro.com/). We also encourage the use of architecture modelling tools such as [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) or equivalent diagrams as code tools such as [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/), [Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/) or [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
