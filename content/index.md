# Engineering and Data handbook

## Why

As a community we've realised we wanted one place to gather together all resources around what works best at Hippo. For some background on why Hippo Digital, head over to the founders' story file on [bamboohr](https://hippodigital.bamboohr.com/files/)

This Handbook should be the starting point regardless if you are new or a veteran here. It provides an overview of why we exist our roles, our investment into staff welfare, our team norms, and details of our processes, policies and benefits.
    
> It's definitely not because we've shamelessly copied it from somewhere else.
