# Resettlement passport

**bold 900 people leave prison in an average week but reoffending rates remain high, costing society over Â£18 billion a year1 text**.

The vision is to provide a comprehensive and efficient service that empowers prison staff in managing the resettlement process for prisoners, whilst enabling prison leavers to access the support they need to lead crime-free lives on release.
