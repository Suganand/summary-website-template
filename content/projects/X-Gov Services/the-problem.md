# The Problem

This hub showcases all of the work weâ€™ve done on a proof of concept exploring a seamless, joined up and personalised experience for users when completing sequential tasks across more than one government service

### Overview

Using multiple government services to complete a task can be a fragmented and laborious user experience.

Users need to understand and navigate the structure of government to work out what's relevant to them.

They will often need to input the same information many times, across each service.

### The Objective

Exploring a seamless, joined up and personalised experience for users when completing sequential tasks across more than one government service.

As a team we approached this as a proof of concept, designing in a future state that reflects this scenario
