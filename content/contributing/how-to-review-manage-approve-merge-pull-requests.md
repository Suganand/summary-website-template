# How to review/manage/approve/merge Pull Requests

This page explains about working with Pull Requests (PRs) of the Hippo Way handbook. A PR (Pull Request) is a proposed source code change to fix a bug/defect or to add new feature. The change would be in a forked branch. PR will be reviewed, approved and merged into the main branch. 

Youâ€™ll need a **GitHub** account to review/manage/approve/merge Pull Requests.
