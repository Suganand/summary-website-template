# Renaming a section

This page explains how you can rename a section in the left hand navigation of the Hippo Way handbook.   
Example, here in the screen shot, there are three sections: Public, Ways Of Working & Contributing.

Section is a collection of pages. Here in the screen shot, you can see many pages under a section.

Section's source code is a folder in GitHub Repo (Repository). And the pages (in handbook) are the files (under the folder in GitHub Repo).
