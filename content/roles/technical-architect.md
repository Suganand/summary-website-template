# Technical Architect

## Description

A Technical Architect is responsible for the overall technical design and delivery for a project, often working with or in some projects as the Technical Lead, and other engineers.  You are the point of contact for all external technical queries, and as such you should provide clean and clear documentation that allows internal / external stakeholders and project members to unambiguously understand the technical solution.  

## What's unique about a Technical Architect in Hippo?

Unlike other organisations, Technical Architects at Hippo are expected to be hands on.  This allows Technical Architects to understand the impact of their technology choices and make changes to the design, if appropriate, at the earliest possible moment.  

## Skillsets and technologies {#skillsets}

You should have all of the skillsets outlined in [Software engineer](software-engineer.md#skillsets) with the following skills in addition  

* The ability to communicate between technical and non-technical people within both your own team, and senior stakeholders.  You can translate technical concepts relating to software engineering, delivery management and service management so they are understood by all.
* Turning business problems into technical design, working with business and technology stakeholders to translate business problems into technical designs, creating optimal designs through iterative processes and aligning the system requirements and organisational objectives with the user needs.
* Understanding the whole context, looking beyond the immediate technical problem and identify the wider implications, and understanding how current work fits in broader contexts and strategies.
* Understanding of architectural frameworks.  We use a very lightweight variant of [TOGAF](https://www.opengroup.org/togaf), and it is import to have a general understanding of the ambitions of architecture frameworks, as our clients may us other frameworks
* Understanding of evaluating trade-offs in technology selection
* Familiarity of understanding securing and scaling systems, making them align to non-functional requirements (NFR's)
* Be an expert in one or more cloud services.  Hippo primarily operate within AWS and Azure.

## Responsibilities {#responsibilities}

As well as the responsibilities outlined in [Software engineer](software-engineer.md#responsibilities) a technical architect should  

* Understand a clients development practices and ensure that the software engineers in the team are following them
* Ensure that the project follows the any technical governance process that is outlined by the client. If there isn't one in place then you should follow the lightweight governance process outlined in the [architecture ways of working document](/ways-of-working/architecture.md#governance)
