## Description

The role of a data analyst encompasses collecting, cleaning and analysing data to draw out patterns and trends to aid informed decision making processes. A data analyst is pivotal in interpreting client needs, and deriving informed, actionable insights from client data. Our data analysts not only have a broad understanding of numerical and statistical methods, but have the inter-personal skills necessary to translate complex data into an easy-to-understand and digestible - and often visual - story for our wide variety of clients. 
Data analysts interpret and make recommendations based on historical data, but also use predictive modelling methods for forecasting. 

It is worth noting that ‘data analyst’ is one of many terms that businesses and organisations might use to describe similar roles, perhaps with different focuses or specialities, e.g. performance analyst, insight analyst, digital analyst. Hippo’s data analysts have experience in a wide range of organisations and industries, such as government and public sector, charity, environmental organisations, advanced manufacturing, R&D, academia, and e-commerce.
