# Roles and levels

We have a variety of roles at hippo across engineering and data these currently include 

* [Software Engineer](/roles/software-engineer.md)
* [Data Engineer](/roles/data-engineer.md)
* [QA/Test Engineer](/roles/qa-test-engineer.md)
* [Data Analyst](/roles/data-analyst.md)
* [Data Scientist](/roles/data-scientist.md)
* [Technical Architect](/roles/technical-architect.md)

## Levels 

Each role is split into several levels

* Principal
* Lead
* Senior
* Intermediate
* Consultant

There is also a Managing Consultant level, but this role sits outside of the portfolios. A management consultant often has a deep area of expertise but is also very quality and commercially aware; they are able to enter projects on their own or provide key guidance on how to implement or save projects that are currently not performing.

The set of requirements for each level are outlined in the [Skills framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1veclKwLUe0GP7nwuDPtq6zEgC6WmkH1nJMTO5JfTECI/edit#gid=1609719988), additionally there is more information available the [Skills framework - banding definition document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SSi17Lu67BtG0pkuuaRKpJzk8s0QOt4Ilm48n-Rk5Vc/edit#slide=id.g218b9a6f43f_0_4)
