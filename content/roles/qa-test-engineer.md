# QA / Test Engineer

## Description

A QA / Test engineer is responsible for quality aspects of a project (excluding code quality). As a QA / Test engineer you are expected to work across a multi-disciplinary team ensuring that the delivery is robust under the requirements and aligned to user needs. You are expected to work in both a manual and automated paradigms. As such you should work closely with project developers and technical architects to understand the solution so you can devise a test strategy that is maintainable throughout the project lifecycle

## What's unique about a QA / Test engineer in Hippo?

At Hippo all of the projects we do are complex, and your job as a QA / Test engineer is to ensure that the software that we deliver is functionally tested, whilst considering non-functional requirements and performance.  You need to have the capability of making the impact in a short span of time, by adapting to the culture, technology and tools that the clients use/follow.  Working in a multi-disciplinary team, you are expected to contribute to shaping tickets and provide critical feedback on designs and stories at all parts of the lifecycle, not just when the software needs testing.  We always need to ensure the user needs, that are defined in the acceptance criteria of the user stories, are met when testing software.
