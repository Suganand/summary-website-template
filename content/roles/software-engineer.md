# Software Engineer

## Description

A software engineer is the person responsible for delivering quality software to the client.  A key part of the role is finding simplicity in complexity, writing less code often requires more thought than layering complexity.  

## What's unique about a Software Engineer in Hippo?

At Hippo all of the projects we do are complex, and your job as a software developer is to ensure that this complexity is represented in the delivered system in the simplest form.  This is true for all parts of software development, infrastructure, build, test and deployment.  Working in a multi-disciplinary team, you are expected to contribute to shaping tickets and provide critical feedback on designs and stories at all parts of the lifecycle, not just when the software needs developing.  We always should consider the user needs when designing software, based on evidence.
