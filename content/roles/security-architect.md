## Description
A Security Architect assesses, advises on and designs security solutions for complex systems.

## What's unique about a Data Engineer in Hippo?
At Hippo all of the projects we do are complex, and your job as a Security Architect is to ensure that security is considered at every stage of the delivery. Working in a multidisciplinary team, you are expected to provide critical feedback on designs, advise on best practice and help shape the implementation. You must always consider client needs as part of your architectural decision-making.

## Skillsets and Technologies
* Visualise and articulate complex problems and concepts by interrogating and using data or intelligence, formulate and influence solutions and plans. Interpret complex business and technical issues and identify viable solutions or controls. Understand and link complex and diverse sets of information to inform the response and approach (for example, identifying vulnerabilities and their impact).
* Understand security concepts deeply to engage with security technologists and communicate in language thatâ€™s appropriate to your audience. Successfully respond to challenges.
* Identify security issues in system architectures. Design secure system architectures through the application of patterns and principles, to meet user needs while managing risks. 
* Make and guide effective decisions on risk, and explain clearly how the decision has been reached. Make decisions proportionate to the level of technical complexity and risk.
* Understand and correctly apply a range of user research methods. Choose appropriate methods for different situations or phases of a product life cycle.
* Demonstrate knowledge of system architectures. Interpret threat intelligence against the architecture. Understand the risk impact of vulnerabilities on existing and future designs and systems. 
* Understanding security implications of transformation. Work with business and technology stakeholders to understand the security implications of business change. Interpret and apply an understanding of policy and process, business architecture, and other potential security implications to assist in the development of technical solutions or controls.
